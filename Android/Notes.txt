points to care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) add the Code with the ppt
2) Add the content on the Security 
3) Remove Media API - topic
4) Locatoin serviecs / Gmap - make it one
4) concentrate on services AIDL, 
5) Remove Other topics (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
6) how to use DDMS/ - debugging
7) Threads and process (User thread, etc) – Handlers and loopers 
8) Creating first Android application - Cover structure of APK (
9) Use of images (copyright issues)
10) User version 2.3
11) new feature in 3.0 ()

Introduction to Android 
 Android is a software stack with a package on your mobile and Set of Development tools.
 Phone has OS, App framework, Android Runtime, Linux Kernal (Drivers). Dev tools (SDK) has API (Java), command line tools, Emulators, Debugging tools.

Features of Android
 Highly reusable components (API)
 Optimized Dalvik Virtual machine (Linux kernal)
 Integrated Browser (WebKit engine) - Support for HTML 5
 2D Graphics (SGL engine) & 3D graphics with support for OpenGL ES 1.0 specification.
 SQLite (Open source project for relational like Data storage)
 Telephony (GSM, EDGE, 3G, WiFi)
 Camera, Compass, NFC, accelerometer GPS (Hardware dependent)
 
Android Architecture

Linux kernal
 Linux 2.6 is used for all system level support. all the functionality such as security, process management, driver model, network stack and memory management is handled by kernal.

Libraries
 Set of C/C++ libraries used by various components of system. can be used thru API by the developers. 

 --- xxx ----

Android Runtime
 Every app runs in its own process, with its own instance of Dalvik VM. Many Dalvik VM's can run efficiently in device. VM can run the .dex files which are like .class files. Java class files are converted into .dex files by the "dx" tool. Dalvik uses linux kernal for multi threading, low-level memory management, system calls, etc.

Application framework
 In built apps and apps developed by us are given same level of access and priority. All the resources available for the inbuilt app is given to our app also. We can replace the components that are part of core applications (subject to security enforeced by framework).
 Below form the base (and available) for all applications. 
 
 Views - like lists, girds, text boxes, embeddable web browser
 Content providers - 
 Resource managers - providing access to non-code resources like localize strings, graphics, layout files
 Notification manager - used by all apps to send notification / custom alerts in status bar
 Activity manager - Manages app life cycle, provides a common navigation backstack

Applicatoins 
 In built (core apps) appliations mail client, contacts, maps, calender.
