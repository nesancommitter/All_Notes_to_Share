points to care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) add the Code with the ppt
2) Add the content on the Security 
3) Remove Media API - topic
4) Locatoin serviecs / Gmap - make it one
4) concentrate on services AIDL, 
5) Remove Other topics (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
6) how to use DDMS/ - debugging
7) Threads and process (User thread, etc) – Handlers and loopers 
8) Creating first Android application - Cover structure of APK (
9) Use of images (copyright issues)
10) User version 2.3
11) new feature in 3.0 ()

Introduction to Android
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 Android is a software stack with a package on your mobile and Set of Development tools.
 Phone has OS, App framework, Android Runtime, Linux Kernal (Drivers). Dev tools (SDK) has API (Java), command line tools, Emulators, Debugging tools.

History of Android
 --- xxx ----

Features of Android
 Highly reusable components (API)
 Optimized Dalvik Virtual machine (Linux kernal)
 Integrated Browser (WebKit engine) - Support for HTML 5
 2D Graphics (SGL engine) & 3D graphics with support for OpenGL ES 1.0 specification.
 SQLite (Open source project for relational like Data storage)
 Telephony (GSM, EDGE, 3G, WiFi)
 Camera, Compass, NFC, accelerometer GPS (Hardware dependent)
 
Android Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux kernal
 Linux 2.6 is used for all system level support. all the functionality such as security, process management, driver model, network stack and memory management is handled by kernal.

Libraries
 Set of C/C++ libraries used by various components of system. can be used thru API by the developers. 
 ? A media library for playback of audio and video media
 ? A surface manager to provide display management
 ? Graphics libraries that include SGL and OpenGL for 2D and 3D graphics
 ? SQLite for native database support
 ? SSL andWebKit for integrated web browser and Internet security

Android Runtime
 Every app runs in its own process, with its own instance of Dalvik VM. Many Dalvik VM's can run efficiently in device. VM can run the .dex files which are like .class files. Java class files are converted into .dex files by the "dx" tool. Dalvik uses linux kernal for multi threading, low-level memory management, system calls, etc.

Application framework
 In built apps and apps developed by us are given same level of access and priority. All the resources available for the inbuilt app is given to our app also. We can replace the components that are part of core applications (subject to security enforeced by framework).
 Below form the base (and available) for all applications. 
 
 Views - like lists, girds, text boxes, embeddable web browser
 Content providers - 
 Resource managers - providing access to non-code resources like localize strings, graphics, layout files
 Notification manager - used by all apps to send notification / custom alerts in status bar
 Activity manager - Manages app life cycle, provides a common navigation backstack

Applicatoins 
 In built (core apps) appliations mail client, contacts, maps, calender. 

Setup of Android Development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System requirements
 One of the great feature of android developement is it can be done in Windows XP/Vista/7 (32-bit & 64-Bit), Mac OS X 10.5.8 (x86 only) and Linux environment also.
 Eclipse 3.5 or greater IDE + Eclipse JDT plugin
 JDK 5 or 6 (6 is better)
 Android Development tools plugin
 With disk space for around 700 Mb for the SDK and tools alone.

Eclipse and SDK installation, AVD creation
 Install Eclipse
 Install Android SDK 
   - Starter package (has Only core tools) is used to download all the SDK components
   - The location of the SDK directory will be required for setting up the ADT plugin and when SDK tools are used from command line.
 Install ADT (Android Dev Tools) plug-in for Eclipse
   - Helps you to quickly set up new Android projects, create an application UI, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools.
 Adding Platforms and Other Components
   - AVD manager is used to download required SDK components into Dev environment. SDK (Android platform versions, Add-ons, tools, Samples and documentation are separate installable components). SDK already installed has only latest version of SDK Tools. 
   - You need atleast one android platform and associated platform tools.
   - In Eclipse Window -> Android SDK and AVD manager
   - or invoke SDK Manager.exe

Types of Components offered
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 > SDK Tools - Used for debugging and testing the apps, present in <SDk>/tools/ directory.
 > SDK Platform-tools - platform-dependent tools for developing and debugging your application, present in <sdk>/platform-tools/ directory.
 > Android platforms - An SDK platform (contains fully compliant Android library, system image, sample code, and emulator skins) is available for every production Android platform deployable to Android-powered devices.
 > USB Driver for Windows - driver files so that you can run and debug your applications on an actual device.
 > Samples - Contains the sample code and apps available for each Android development platform. 
 > Documentation - Local copy of the Documentaion of the framework
