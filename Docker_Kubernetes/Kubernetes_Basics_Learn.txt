Kubernetes automates container orchestration, scaling, and management across clusters.

Automated Scaling 	- Horizontally scales apps up/down based on CPU/memory demand
Self-Healing 		- Auto-restarts failed containers, reschedules on healthy nodes
Load Balancing 		- Built-in service discovery + traffic distribution across pods
Rolling Updates 	- Zero-downtime deployments with gradual rollouts/rollbacks
Resource Optimization - Efficient CPU/memory allocation across cluster nodes
Multi-Cloud Portability - Run same apps on AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises
Service Discovery 	- Automatic DNS + network policies between microservices
Configuration Management - Secrets/ConfigMaps decouple config from code
Batch Processing 	- Handles cron jobs, one-off tasks, stateful apps
Disaster Recovery 	- Replicates apps across availability zones automatically
